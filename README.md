# Fifa World Cup 2018

This is my first project written on php.
I love football, it's great game. I both like playing and watching football matches on TV.

When I was a child, I've written all results of Fifa World Cup matches to my copybook. 

So I've decided to make online copybook for World Cup in 2018 on php, simple MySql database, html and javascript.

There are some screenshots:
